# Game Jam Game: One Must Imagine Sisyphus Happy

This is a game inspired by the greek myth of Sisyphus where a king was sentenced to roll a boulder up a hill for all eternity only for it to roll back down when it reaches the top. The name of the game came from a quote of the book by the French philosopher Albert Camus called "The Myth of Sisyphus"(it also use to be a meme).

I made this game in 4 days for a Game Jam for the Girls Who Code(GWC) SIP. The theme of the Game Jam was "What Hope Means to You" and the Sisyphus myth reminded me of human resilience and the hoping and working for better things.

I made this project by modding one of the other games I created during the GWC SIP. I made a collection style game during the program where you have to collect as many falling objects as you can. For this project, I modified that game so that instead of collecting the falling objects, you have to avoid the falling objects. Then, I added a home screen, rule screen and win and lose screens. I also added a restart button so that the game can start without having to refresh.

There were a lot of bugs when making this game, for instance, I was having a hard time making sure that when the buttons are clicked, they go to the right screen and I also had problems with the lightning bolts not falling, and buttons not working sometimes. I learned a lot about how to make functions, how screens work, and how sprites can interact with each other.
